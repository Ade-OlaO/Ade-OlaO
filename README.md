## Hello 👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾

### Bio
My name is Adeola and I am currently learning the Fundamentals of Cloud Web Development as part of a Skills Bootcamp with CoGrammar.

My GitHub profile serves as a portfolio of my projects as I progress through this bootcamp and begin to build my career as a developer.

### Why am I on a bootcamp?
I decided to pursue this bootcamp for a career change from Customer Service and Adminstrative work, but I realise that it is also an opportunity for me to challenge myself and pursue my existing interest in IT. 

I will use this bootcamp to see what I am capable of achieving in just a few short months alongside my current job.

### What skills am I developing?
I am developing skills in the following tools:
* HTML and CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* MongoDB

### Fun Fact!
I enjoy playing puzzle games in my spare time. I especially like Point 'n' Click adventure games and have a collection of both physical and digital copies of these games. I have a lot of them to get through, including a lot of the classics and my backlog keeps growing. I am very partial to a detective story as I enjoy a good mystery! 🔎🔎🔎
